# notes directory

I take daily notes in markdown files on topics such as meetings, projects, todos. These are located at 

    ~/Documents/current

Some important ones are:

    ~/Documents/current/meeting.md # meeting notes
    ~/Documents/current/oncall_20250922.md # notes from a oncall shift
    ~/Documents/current/Project # notes about projects
    ~/Documents/current/DevEnv # development environments or design notes for services, infra, components
    ~/Documents/current/TODO.md # master todo list with related notes

Other documents (like project files) often have their own todo lists as well.
